# JavaScript_Card_Game
Hunt the Ace, find the ace hidden among 3 other randomly shuffled cards.

# Styling
I used html and css for the visual aspects with some imported code features for the 'play game' button and the text font style

Cards were arranged using grid positioning to evenly space them out
